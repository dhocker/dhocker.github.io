Welcome to GrumpyDave's (aka dhocker or Dave Hocker) GitHub web site. Here you will find
musings about the various GitHub housed projects that I've worked on.

- Posts about research topics and projects
- Notes about the GitHub repos under my account

My projects tend to involve hardware of some kind of software to make the hardware
do something useful. For example, you will find two projects that together form an X10 home control
system: [athomepowerlineserver](https://github.com/dhocker/athomepowerlineserver) 
and [ahps_web](https://github.com/dhocker/ahps_web). 

Continuing in that vain, I am currently working on a DMX based lighting project. This involves
a DMX lighting controller and software to drive the controller with lighting scripts.
The driving force for this project is the desire to have a year-end holiday
light show in my front yard.

I particularly enjoy working with the Raspberry Pi (RPi). As a result a number of my projects
are deployed on RPi's (e.g. the X10 system).

My development language of choice is Python. This mostly comes from the RPi influence. However,
I have worked with a fair number of languages during my professional years. So, languages 
like C/C++, C# and Ruby (to name a few) are not out of the question.

I do most of my development on OS X and Raspbian Jessie. I occassionally use Ubuntu (just
upgraded to 16.04) and Windows 10. I spent most of my professional career on Windows
(and DOS before that and VM/370 and MVS before that).

Finally, this web site was constructed using Jekyll. It was a non-trivial project all by itself and is
probably worth a post or two.

title: ColorCycler - Algorithms for generating RGB color sequences
---

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/colorcycler](https://github.com/dhocker/colorcycler)

This package contains algorithms for generating RGB color sequences.
Initially, it contains a single algorithm that generates sine based
color sequences.

Currently, this package works under both Python 2 and Python 3.
However, it prefers Python 3.

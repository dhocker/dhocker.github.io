title: ahps_web - Web App for Managing AtHomePowerlineServer
---

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/ahps_web](https://github.com/dhocker/ahps_web)

ahps\_web is a companion web server for the [AtHomePowerlineServer](https://www.github.com/dhocker/athomepowerlineserver).
It will allow you to control one running instance of the AtHomePowerlineServer from any web browser (it has been tested
with Chrome and Firefox).

Like the AtHomePowerlineServer it was designed to run on a light weight system (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) that can be run head-less
and fan-less. This is as opposed to a PC or Mac based solution. The small size of such a system like the Raspberry Pi allows
it to be positioned more freely (ideally, close to the breaker panel). And, a Raspberry Pi system can be assembled for
considerably less than a PC. While the server was designed to run on a lightweight system, it will run on any system that
supports Python 2.7 (including Windows) and the Flask framework.

Also, like AtHomePowerlineServer application, ahps\_web is open source. Anyone can fork it and build upon it.

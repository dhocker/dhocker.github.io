title: AtHomeDMX - DMX Lighting Control Server
---

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/athomedmx](https://github.com/dhocker/athomedmx)

AtHomeDMX is designed to run simple DMX controlled light shows. A show is constructed via a relatively simple
scripting language. The original driving force for the program was for
something to run a holiday lighting program.

A TCP/IP connection is used to control AtHomeDMX (similar to the way mpd is controlled). 
A client as simple as telnet can be used. I plan to
develop an AgentDMX web app (TBD) as a more sophisticated client.

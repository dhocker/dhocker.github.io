title: LED-Emulator - LED String Emulator for AtHomeLED
---

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/led-emulator](https://github.com/dhocker/led-emulator)

This app was designed to be a test tool for the AtHomeLED LED controller. 
It basically provides a string of LEDs that can be driven by AtHomeLED scripts. 
The number of LEDs defaults to 50, but can be changed through a configuration file.

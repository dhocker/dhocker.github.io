title: udmx-pyusb - Programming the Anyma uDMX
---

Project web site: [http://dhocker.github.io/udmx-pyusb/](http://dhocker.github.io/udmx-pyusb/)

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/udmx-pyusb](https://github.com/dhocker/udmx-pyusb)

The purpose of this repo is to share what I have learned about programming the
Anyma uDMX interface using Python and PyUSB on the Raspberry Pi (RPi). The Anyma uDMX
interface is relatively inexpensive and there are a large number of clones available 
from sites like eBay. However, there seems to be a dearth of information available for
programming this interface under Linux (Raspbian Jessie in this case).

The [Readme.md](https://github.com/dhocker/udmx-pyusb/blob/master/Readme.md) file in the repo contains 
my notes from this project.

The end product of this project was the udmx-pyusb package. The package is suitable
for use with pip and can be downloaded from the [project web site](http://dhocker.github.io/udmx-pyusb/)

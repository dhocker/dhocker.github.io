title: Susannas-library-frb: Book library tracking app
---

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/susannas-library-frb.git](https://github.com/dhocker/susannas-library-frb.git)

This is about the third incarnation of a library tracking app that my wife uses.
She keeps track of nearly 500 authors and about 3,000 books. The authors and books
are ones that she has read, wants to read or wants to avoid. At one time she had
a physical library of well over 500 books. However, when we moved from Atlanta
to Houston she donated away most all of them. These days she prefers ebooks
that she reads on her Nexus 7.

This implementation uses Python Flash, SQLite, React and Boostrap.

At home, I run it on a Raspberrypi v3 under NGINX and uWSGI (emperor mode).

Repo: [https://github.com/dhocker/MPD](https://github.com/dhocker/MPD)

Reference: [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/)

This repo is a straight fork of the Music Player Daemon project housed
at [https://github.com/MaxKellermann/MPD](https://github.com/MaxKellermann/MPD).
Originally, I created this fork for two purposes. First, I wanted a C/C++ project
for "practice". It had been quite a while since I worked on any sizable
C/C++ project and this one was certainly large enough to meet that need. Second,
I thought there might be some customizations that I would like to make because
I wanted to run MPD on a Raspberry Pi. As of this
time, that assumption has turned out to be false.

My fork contains a "map" branch where I experimented with some non-functional
changes. This was a purely educational endeavor.

At this time, I just track the changes from the MPD project. I routinely build
the changes on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Jessie and on OS X 10.11.x.
Every now and then I come across a build error. In this small way my
fork provides some benefit back to the MPD project.

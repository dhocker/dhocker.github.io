title: AgentMPD - Yet Another MPD Client
---

AgentMPD is a web server based client app for the [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org) music server.
It will also work with the [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/) music server.
It will allow you to control one running instance of mpd from any web browser (it has been tested
with Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Developer Edition and Brave).

AgentMPD was written in Python/Flask to run on a light weight system (e.g. a Raspberry Pi).
While the server app was designed to run on a lightweight system, it will run on any system that
supports Python 2.7 (including Windows) and the Flask framework. The mpd music server can be running
anywhere as long as you can get to it via a TCP/IP connection.

AgentMPD is open source. Anyone can fork it and build upon it.
